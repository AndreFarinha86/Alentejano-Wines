                <h2>Travel Guide to Alentejo Wine Region</h2>
                <p>Situated between Algarve and Lisboa regions, Alentejo wine region covers more than 30% of Portugal
                    and it is the largest in the country. Not only is it impressive in size but also in its wine
                    production and living tradition of millenary wines of Talha. The region has eight subregions, each
                    boasting a wealth of mouth-watering cuisines, excellent wine, and tourism experiences that are an
                    absolute pleasure for the senses. From vineyards that stretch as far as the horizon to mountain
                    ranges and beaches, Alentejo has something for everybody.</p>
                <p>Alentejo wine region was initially known across Portugal for its cork production. This changed in the
                    1980s when the European Union provided funding to Alentejo wine cooperatives to produce high-quality
                    wines. The help of EU funding resulted in a renaissance of winemaking in Alentejo and brought
                    innovations to the region that holds millenary wine traditions. Thanks to this, by 2020 the wine
                    region is producing the country’s largest proportion of quality Portuguese wines.</p>

                <h2>Talha Wine - Living Tradition of Alentejo Wine Region</h2>
                <p>Sunny villages of the Alentejo wine region shelter the ancient technique of Talha winemaking. Talha
                    Wine is a living tradition, which counts for more than 2000 years. This unique tradition has been
                    handed down from generation to generation and Talha wines are still produced in the same way in clay
                    Amphoras, as in Ancient Romans times. While Georgia is considered to be home to ancient winemaking
                    and amphora wines, Portugal is the only country that has dedicated appellation to only amphora
                    wines.</p>
                <p>Vinho de Talha brings natural aromas, minerality, and deep golden color with an orange hue for the
                    white Alentejo wines. As for red Alentejo wines, they display intense purple color and expressive
                    aromas of red and black berries.</p>

                <p>A traditional and sophisticated winery with unique characteristics that are perfect for the
                    production of distinctive wines with the highest quality.</p>
                <p>Inspired by the best traditional wineries of the Alentejo, our winery was built upon an
                    enologicalconcept, which respects and explores the excellent quality of the grapes.</p>
                <p>Located just a few meters away from the vineyard, the cellar takes advantage of the sloping terrain
                    which allows the entire wine-making process by gravity. The grapes arrive packed in small boxes of
                    12 kg and are unloaded directly into the modern refrigerated wineries where treading perfectly
                    blends thetraditional winemaking methods and technology in order to get the full potential that
                    Nature offered the grapes in the vineyard. You can book a guided tour to its unique cellar, have
                    regional food tastings, and taste great Alentejo wines.</p>
                <p>Another decisive factor in our wines is the manual selection of the grapes; only the best grapes are
                    selected. The best among the best </p>
                <p>Fermentation occurs inside tronco-conic vats, which allow for a soft phenolic (tannins) extraction.
                </p>
                <p>The aging cellar has a capacity for 350 barrels, which are naturally acclimatized by the cellar’s
                    ancient granite walls.</p>
                <p>Here will find experiences such as a guided tour of the wine cellar, and food and wine tasting of
                    some of the best Alentejo wines and regional products.</p>

                <p>In the heart of Alentejo, the vines are geographically integrated in the denominated wine producing
                    area of Vinho Regional Alentejano. As far back as the Roman times, wine was produced in this area.
                </p>
                <p>The vineyard was installed in three phases. The first phase in 2001 (10 hectares), the second in 2003
                    (14 hectares) and more recently a 3-hectare installation of white wine grape vines.</p>
                <p>Chosen in accordance with the characteristics of the terroir, the varieties used in our blends and
                    varietals include: Aragonêz, Trincadeira, Alicante Bouschet, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Verdelho,
                    Arinto, and Alvarinho.</p>
                <p>The soil is mostly granite in composition, well drained, and with soft slopes. The varieties have
                    been planted in a way, which maximizes their potential in this type of topography.</p>
                <p>The climate is mediterranean with a continental influenced microclimate. Annual precipitations
                    average 900 mm and there are well-marked thermal amplitudes.</p>
                <p>The conduction system in all the varieties is the bilateral cordon, the pruning being done in a way
                    that respects the fructification habits of each vine, aiming for a production total of 5,000/6,000
                    kg/ha.</p>
                <p>The vineyard is irrigated by a drip irrigation system, water management being done according to the
                    year’s established parameters.</p>

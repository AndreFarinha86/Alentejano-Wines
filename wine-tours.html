                <P>Alentejo has a predominantly Mediterranean climate - hot, dry and sunny, with large continental
                    influence, which translates into unique conditions for the vineyard cultivation. The landscape is
                    made up of wide plains and hills, with a predominance of clay, granite, limestone, and schist soil.
                </P>
                <div class="more-text">
                    <P>Alentejo demarcated region is divided into eight sub-regions: Reguengos, Borba, Redondo,
                        Vidigueira,
                        Évora, Granja-Amareleja, Portalegre and Moura. It is also grouped in three poles: Portalegre,
                        center
                        and south Alentejo.</P>
                    <P>In the Portalegre region the microclimate is influenced by the low temperatures of São Mamede
                        Mountain, where the main vineyards of this region are planted on the steep mountain hillsides
                        and on
                        granite soils.</P>
                    <P>In the centre of Alentejo are the sub-regions of Borba, Reguengos, Redondo and Évora. Borba is
                        the
                        second largest sub-region of Alentejo. Reguengos is one of the main sub-regions of Alentejo,
                        with
                        Reguengos de Monsaraz as its ex-libris, elected the European Wine City in 2015.</P>
                    <P>In the south of Alentejo, hotter and drier, are the sub-regions of Moura, Vidigueira and
                        Granja-Amareleja.</P>

                <p>In order to get to know the region's food and wine culture nothing better than visiting a winery,
                    where you can learn about the whole process of winemaking, visit the facilities, the vineyards as
                    well as taste the true nectar, accompanied by the local gastronomy delicacies. The region also
                    provides a wide range of leisure activities related to wine, such as, the Festival of Vine and Wine,
                    in Borba, which takes places every year in summer. Other places to visit are Redondo Wine Museum,
                    where several aspects of Alentejo winemaking are displayed, or also the Alentejo Wine Route Tasting
                    Room, in Évora, a World Heritage City.</p>
                <div class="more-text">
                    <p>The Alentejo Wine Route can be subdivided into three main routes: " São Mamede Route",
                        "Historical
                        Route" and "Guadiana Route". These routes enable you to experience all the richness of this wide
                        and
                        wonderful region. The "São Mamede Route", located in the area covered by the Natural Park of São
                        Mamede Mountain, includes some of the most beautiful and typical Alentejo cities and villages,
                        such
                        as Portalegre, Marvão, Castelo de Vide, Alter do Chão or Sousel. The "Historical Route" is
                        centred
                        in Évora but also comprises the areas of Arraiolos, Estremoz, Borba, Vila Viçosa, Redondo and
                        Monsaraz. At last, the "Guadiana Route" marked by the presence of the river with this very name
                        and
                        by the vast plains, ranging Mourão, Moura, Vidigueira, Alvito and Viana do Alentejo.</p>
                    <p>The Alentejo regional gastronomy is synonymous with flavour, intensity and passion, the açordas
                        or
                        bread soups, migas (cornbread dish), gazpacho, lamb stew, Alentejo pork meat with clams, or the
                        purslane soup are some of the most prized dishes in this region.</p>

                <div class="more-text">
                    <p>We will go to the vineyards and start by checking the maturity of the different grape varieties.
                        If
                        the sugar concentration is ideal, we will harvest by hand, but only enough not to get tired!
                        After
                        breakfast in the vineyard, the rest of the winemaking work follows.</p>
                    <p>Back to the winery, you will participate in whatever tasks are taking place- it could be the
                        'inoculation' of a vat, to start the fermentation, a 'pump over' where the must is pumped over
                        the
                        skins and seeds to aid maceration or a “devatting”, drawing off the wine. As tradition dictates,
                        we
                        then crush the grapes with our bare feet and, of course, taste wine!</p>
                    <p>At the end, as a souvenir of the experience, a bottle of wine will be offered to each
                        participant.

                <p>Join us on a 4×4 tour along the dirt roads of the estate. Absorb the knowledge of our guides and feel
                    proud to call the Alentejo your home.</p>
                <div class="more-text">
                    <p>Discover our special connection to the generous lands of the Alentejo, from which we produce
                        cork,
                        wine, Iberian pork and honey. Immerse yourself deep in the cork oak forest to understand how
                        cork
                        grows and is appreciated in the Alentejo. Feel its ecosystem, drink pure water, smell the
                        flowers
                        and touch the trees. Get out of the jeep to feel the textures, appreciate the view, and learn
                        through experience. At the end of the tour, climb the hillside and enjoy an incredible 360º
                        view, of
                        the boundaries of the estate and the beautiful landscape.</p>
                    <p>After the jeep tour, discover the world of wines on a guided tour of the estate, where you will
                        visit
                        the winery and tasting room. Then you will enjoy a tasting of wines, accompanied by Iberian pork
                        ham
                        and cheese.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the morning, filled with activities, you will have lunch in a typical Alentejo
                        restaurant, with a traditional menu of the region, accompanied by Alentejo wines.</p>
                    <P>Adventure yourself on an off-road journey through the Alentejo's "montado" (cork oak forest)!</P>
